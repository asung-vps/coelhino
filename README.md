# Coelhino

## TODO:
- Implement init command:
  - Create YAML project file in optionally specified directory
  - Want to set an initConfig function to detect project, but need to figure out how to handle uninitialized project case.
    - Could have a struct that parses YAML file and a flag indicating whether the context is initialized or not

## Notes:
- `coelhino` seems to be too long of a command, but I'll keep it for now
